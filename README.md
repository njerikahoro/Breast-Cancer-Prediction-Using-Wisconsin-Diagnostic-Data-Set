# Breast Cancer Prediction – Capstone Project
Machine Learning Model for Early Diagnosis using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset

1. Project Overview
Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women globally. Early detection significantly improves survival rates, but access to reliable diagnostics is limited in many regions.
This project builds a machine learning model that predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using diagnostic features derived from breast mass cell nuclei. The goal is to support early detection and provide a foundation for decision-support systems in healthcare.
This project was completed as part of the Capstone requirement for the Machine Learning Program.

2. Objectives
Build a supervised classification model to distinguish malignant vs. benign breast tumors.
Compare multiple machine learning algorithms and select the best-performing model.
Assess model performance using clinically meaningful metrics (recall, precision, ROC-AUC).
Document the workflow clearly and reproducibly using GitHub and a written report.
Provide insights, limitations, and recommendations for real-world application.
